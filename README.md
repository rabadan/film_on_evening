# Film for the evening
This is a small console utility that offers us some movie for viewing, 
having previously asked the user for the desired director


The program is written in `Ruby`

#### Launching  
- You must have Ruby interpreter installed
- For work it is still necessary to establish the necessary gems:
```
bundle install
```

To run the application, type:
```
ruby main.rb
```
